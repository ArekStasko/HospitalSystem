# Hello in my - HospitalRegistration - Project !

## What is this project ?

I want to make system that will help people in contact with hospital personel. 
System will have options for administrator, doctors and patients.

- Patients will be able to see hospitals and info about them like count of free visits and 
  of course they will have opportunity to make an appointment.

- Doctors will be able to see their visits and hospital where they work.

- Administrators can add hospitals and doctors.

For now i will not implement authorization functionality, i will provide it during application development
and when i develop my skills into higher level
